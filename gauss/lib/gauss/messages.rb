      Hi I'm Gauss, and here's how I can help you

      Help guide:
        - CMD: 'What do you have?' - I'll show you all the items in stock/and their prices
        - CMD: 'Give me '{{ name of product, quantity }}' - I'll tell you the price and subsequently ask you for the amount of money
        - CMD: 'Take {{ amount of money (2p, 14p, Â£1.2) }}' - I'll try to get the item for you if enough money is provided else ---\__(o_o)__/--
        - CMD: 'Help': I'll share this again
        - CMD: 'Load': I'll reset the records and sync with what's in the csv
        - CMD: 'Gauss Thanks': Alright ciao!
